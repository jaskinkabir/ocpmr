# On the Computing Power of Minecraft Redstone
- Many of my friends had mentioned to me that they didn't quite understand digital logic
- We all grew up on Minecraft, and Minecraft was actually my first exposure to digital logic. It is one of the main reasons I am a computer engineer today
- I figured that it would be easier for them to understand digital logic through a medium that has been familar to them since childhood
- So I put together a lecture about digital logic using Minecraft Redstone

    - I created a Minecraft world where I built different Redstone circuits
    - They started from demonstrations of the basic mechanics of Redstone, worked up to simple logic gates, then to S/R latches and T-flip-flops, and finally to the components I used to build a Tic-Tac-Toe machine

    - To demonstrate the complexity that a Minecraft logic circuit can achieve, I built this machine that allows two people to play Tic-Tac-Toe together
    - I used this during the lecture to demonsrate how designing such a machine is not as difficult as it may seem, and that if you break the design into smaller parts it becomes a simpler task.
- I made a PowerPoint presentation compiling all the information and invited my friends to come watch my lecture
- 17 of my friends came to watch me talk about Minecraft and digital logic on a Friday night
- The overwhelming response was that they had a much deeper understanding of digital logic after the lecture, which made me very happy to hear
