# On the Computing Power of Minecraft Redstone
- Many of my friends had mentioned to me that they didn't quite understand digital logic
- We all grew up on Minecraft
    - Minecraft was actually my first exposure to digital logic, and one of the main reasons I am a computer engineer today
- So I put together a lecture about digital logic using Minecraft Redstone
- I figured that it would be easier for them to understand digital logic through a medium that has been familar to them since childhood
- The overwhelming response was that they had a much deeper understanding after the lecture
- I was very happy to hear that, and I hope that this lecture can help others understand digital logic as well
- The video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jjv6e8v4p0)
    - Please note that the audience is made up of my close friends, so the language in the video is not exactly professional
## Tic-Tac-Toe
- To demonstrate the complexity that a Minecraft logic circuit can achieve, I built a tic-tac-toe machine in minecraft
    - Allows two people to press buttons to play Tic-Tac-Toe together
- I used this machine during the lecture to demonsrate how designing such a machine is not as difficult as it may seem
    - If you break the design into smaller parts, it becomes a simpler task
